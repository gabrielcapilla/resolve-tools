    git clone https://github.com/your-user/resolve-tools.git
    cd resolve-tools
    ```

2.  **Run the installation script:**
    This command will copy the necessary files to the KDE services directory.

1.  Navigate to the video file you want to be compatible with Resolve.
2.  Right-click on the file.
3.  Select **Resolve Tools ‚Üí Recode Media Files**.
4.  The script will create a subfolder named `media_files` (if it doesn't exist) and save a version of the video in `.mkv` format with the video/audio in a compatible format. A progress bar will show you the status of the operation.

### Extract Audio from Video

1.  Navigate to the video or audio file from which you want to extract the sound.
2.  Right-click on the file.
